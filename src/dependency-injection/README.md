Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to decouple components, improve testability, and make code easier to maintain and scale. In Node.js with TypeScript, DI can be implemented manually or by using libraries like InversifyJS, TSyringe, or typedi.

At its core, Dependency Injection means passing (injecting) dependencies (services, classes, configs, etc.) into a class rather than having that class create them itself.

What is Dependency Injection?
Dependency Injection is a technique where an object receives its dependencies from the outside, rather than creating them itself.

Think of it as “outsourcing the creation of things you depend on”.

Instead of a class saying, “I need a Database so I will create one,” it says, “Please give me a Database.”

🧠 Why is this Important?
Without DI:

Your code creates and manages its own dependencies.

This leads to tight coupling (components are locked together).

Hard to test: You can’t easily swap in mocks or stubs.

With DI:

Your code receives dependencies (via constructor or setter).

Promotes loose coupling, modularity, testability, and clean architecture.

📘 Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you’re a chef (your class), and you need groceries (dependencies). You could:

Without DI: Leave your kitchen, go buy ingredients, and cook.

With DI: Have someone else deliver ingredients to your kitchen.

In DI, you're just focused on cooking (your job), not how the ingredients got there.
